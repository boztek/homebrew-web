homebrew-web
============

This started off as an attempt of creating a small website for homebrew for people to search for available packages.

I kinda hacked together a really janky web front end for the package manager.

Since homebrew is git based, the test.rb script will do the following:

  1) Get a list of all users from the homebrew network
  2) Add each user in the network as a remote and fetch their changes
  3) Will compile a list of what recipes are associated with what users and stick them in a sqlite database (not perfect just yet / accessing from git is VERY slow)

Once test.rb is run, you can load the sinatra app and:

 1) Search for formulas available in the network
 2) Checkout formulas from another user's tree
 3) Install formulas from another user's tree

This isn't perfect yet, but I think its a pretty good first attempt.
